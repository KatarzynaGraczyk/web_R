# web_R

My web_R app is a simply data viewer. It makes possible displaying and sorting table by selected columns. The application is able to show information about data in the summary tab, eg: column class, mean, median and data ranges. On the "Plots" tab user can display three different types of plots. Additionally, user may define which data should be on the axes or specify whether the data should be grouped by some column.

There is possible to make: 

    * box plot
    * scatterplot
    * histograms

Example views are presented below:
